How To LIGGGHTS(R)-INL4.X vs. LIGGGHTS(R)-INL3.X - syntax changes :h3

Introduction: :h4

This is a short outline of the most important changes in LIGGGHTS(R)-INL 4.X
compared to LIGGGHTS(R)-INL 3.X regarding the syntax of major commands. The
motivation for these changes was to make the script language more readable and to
improve extendability (in the sense of object oriented programming) with respect
to modelling approaches.

Commands covered by this tutorial: :h4

fix nve/nonspherical :l
fix multisphere :l
fix concave :l
fix couple/cfd/force :l
fix nve/cfd_cn :l
:ule

Changes in syntax for each command: :h4

Changes are indicated as follows

OLD: old_syntax
NEW: new_syntax  :pre

where {old_syntax} refers to the syntax used in LIGGGHTS(R)-INL 3.X and before,
and {new_syntax} refers to the syntax used in LIGGGHTS(R)-INL 4.X.

:line

[fix nve/nonspherical:]

OLD: fix ID group-ID nve/superquadric
OLD: fix ID group-ID nve/convexhull
NEW: fix ID group-ID nve/nonspherical :pre

All integrators for atom types superquadric and convexhull used to require a
specialized integrator. These integrators have now been combined in a single
"fix nve/nonspherical"_fix_nve_nonspherical.html to improve code quality and
simplify the input script generation

:line

[fix multisphere & fix concave:]

OLD: fix ID group-ID multisphere
NEW: fix ID group-ID multisphere
     fix ID group-ID nve/nonspherical :pre

OLD: fix ID group-ID concave
NEW: fix ID group-ID concave
     fix ID group-ID nve/nonspherical :pre

Previously the "fix multisphere"_fix_multisphere.html would also contain the
multisphere integrator and the same is true for "fix concave"_fix_concave.html.
This is no longer correct due to the rewrite mentioned above. Because of this it
is now necessary to specify an integrator explicitly. As all non-spherical
integrators have been unified into one fix this is the same "fix
nve/nonspherical"_fix_nve_nonspherical.html.

It was possible in 3.X to specify a {fix multisphere/nointegration} the same can
now be achieved by using a {fix multisphere} without the nonspherical
integrator.

:line

[fix nve/cfd_cn & fix couple/cfd/force:]

OLD: fix ID group-ID couple/cfd/force/implicit
     fix ID group-ID nve/sphere
NEW: fix ID group-ID couple/cfd/force
     fix ID group-ID nve/cfd_cn/sphere

The fix couple/cfd/force/implicit has been removed and most functionality was moved
to the regular couple/cfd/force. To consider the drag in an implicit formulation
the integrators fix nve/cfd_cn/* can be used. For more details please read the
CFDEMcoupling documentation.
