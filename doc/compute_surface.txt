compute surface command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID surface general_keyword general_values arg mode input1 input2 ... keyword args ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
surface = style name of this compute command  :l
general_keywords general_values are documented in "compute"_compute.html" :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {angle} or {point_up} or {n_vec_up} or {use_com} or {region} :l
  {angle} values = ang
    ang = maximum contact angle of particle (degrees)
  {point_up} values = px py pz
    px, py, pz = coordinates of point UP (length units)
  {n_vec_up} values = nx ny nz
    nx, ny, nz = coordinates of normal vector NUP (length units)
  {use_com} values = yes or no
    yes = do use particle center of mass for calculation for vector NUP
    no = do not use particle center of mass for calculation for vector NUP
  {region} value = regID
    regID = ID of a "region"_region.html which determines which particles are included in the calculation :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute surf all surface point_up 0.05 0.05 0.05 n_vec_up 1. 1. 0. angle 30 :pre

[Description:]

Define a calculation that computes if a particle is on the surface
of a particle packing, based on two very simple geometric criteria, which
are based on NUP, a normal vector pointing "upwards", and COM, the center of
mass of the fix group

The detection is based on 2 criteria:

(1) the particle is above the plane defined by point COM and vector NUP

AND

(2) the particle must not have any neighboring particle, where the angle
of the neighboring particle to NUP is smaller than {angle}.

The vector NUP can be defined in 2 ways: as (a) vector from center of mass
 of the fix group to UP (as defined by {point_up} ), this is done by using the {use_com}
keyword, or (b) directly via the {n_vec_up} keyword.

A note on keywords: {angle} must be defined, and either - for case (a) -
{use_com} and {point_up} must be defined, or - for case (b) - {n_vec_up}
must be defined.

If the keyword {region} is used a "region"_region.html ID must be provided as
argument to this keyword. In this case the particles considered in the algorithm
described above must be contained in the specified region in order to be
considered.

Please note that the list of neighbors is looped to calculate criterion
(2), which will depend on your "neighbor"_neighbor.html and
"neigh_modify"_neigh_modify.html settings.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please take into account that this is a very coarse
approach, and also "inner surfaces" within the particle packing
may be detected.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a compute calculates a per-atom vector, which
equals 1 if the particle is on the surface, and 0 if the particle
is not on the surface. These values can
be used by any command that uses per-atom vector values from a
compute as input.  See "Section_howto 15"_Section_howto.html#howto_8
for an overview of LIGGGHTS(R)-INL output options.
