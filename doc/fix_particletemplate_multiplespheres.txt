fix particletemplate/multiplespheres command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID particletemplate/multiplespheres seed nspheres nspheresvalue keyword values ntry ntryvalue spheres (or spheres_different_types) values_spheres type mt opt_keyword opt_values :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
particletemplate/multisphere = style name of this fix command  :l
seed = random number generator seed (prime number greater 10000) :l
nspheres = obligatory keyword :l
nspheresvalue = number of spheres in the template (integer value) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs can be appended :l
keyword, values are documented in "fix particletemplate/sphere"_fix_particletemplate_sphere.html command :l
ntry = obligatory keyword :l
ntryvalue: number of tries for Monte Carlo approach :l
spheres or spheres_different_types = obligatory keyword :l
values_spheres = one out of the following options :l
    option 1 (when keyword spheres is used) = {file} {filename}
    option 2 (when keyword spheres is used) = {file} {filename} {scale} {scalefactor}
    option 3 (when keyword spheres is used) = {x1 y1 z1 r1 x2 y2 r2...} where x/y/z are sphere positions and r are the radii
    option 4 (when keyword spheres_different_types is used) = {x1 y1 z1 t1 r1 x2 y2 r2 t2...} where x/y/z are sphere positions, r are the radii and t the atom types :pre
opt_keyword = {bonded} :l
    {bonded} value = 'yes' or 'no'
        yes = bonds are created between adjacent spheres
        no = no bonds are created :pre

[Examples:]

fix pt1 all particletemplate/multiplespheres 123457 atom_type 2 density constant ${dens} nspheres 237 ntry 1000000 spheres file data/frag_hb2_v3.file scale 0.999999  :pre

[Description:]

Define a particle template that is used as input for a
"fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html
command which contains not only one sphere, but multiple spheres. 
The particle parameters (positions, radii) are either defined
manually as arguments to this command or via a text file, via the keyword
{file}. The format of this text file is

x1 y1 z1 r1
x2 y2 z2 r2
... :pre

and the number of lines in this file has to be equal to n_spheres as
defined in this command. Comments can be made in this file via the '#'
character. Optionally, when a file is used for defining the multi-sphere
template, keyword {scale} can be used to define a {scalefactor} to scale
up or down the particle positions and radii.

In case keyword {spheres_different_types} is used, the textfile contains 
the type as last element in each line.

After the spheres are read, a Monte Carlo procedure is used to assess
center of mass of the assembly.

IMPORTANT NOTE: As opposed to the number-based distributions, this fix uses the more common
distribution based on mass-% for the radius distribution (as does
"fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html).

If the {bonded} keyword is set to 'yes' the spheres in one batch of {n_spheres}
are bonded in case the "cohesion model bond"_gran_cohesion_bond.html model is
used and if the particeles satisfy the distance criterion of this model.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Information about the random state in this fix is written to
"binary restart files"_restart.html so you can restart a simulation with
the same particles being chosen for insertion. None of the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this fix. No global
scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this fix for access
by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15. No parameter of this
fix can be used with the {start}/{stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html
command. This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

[Default:]

radius = 1.0, density = 1.0
