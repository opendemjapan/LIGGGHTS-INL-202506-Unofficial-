fix set/vel command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID set/vel keywords values ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
set/vel = style name of this fix command :l
following keyword/value pairs must be appended :l
keyword = {dim} and ({vel} or {omega}) :l
  {dim} value = x or y or z
    x, y, z = component of the velocity vector to be set
  {vel} value = vel_component
    vel_component = value of the velocity component to be set, can be a "variable"_variable.html (velocity units)
  {omega} value = omega_component
    omega_component = value of the omega component to be set, can be a "variable"_variable.html (angular velocity units) :pre
one or more optional keyword/value pairs can be appended :l
optional keyword = {region} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of "region"_region.html atoms must be in to have their (angular) velocity in one direction set 
  {type} value = atom type
    atom type = atom type atoms must be of to have their (angular) velocity in one direction set :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix fixvel all set/vel dim y vel -2.3 region velset
fix fixvel all set/vel dim y omega 10.0 region velset :pre

[Description:]

This fix sets one component of the (angular) velocity of particles in the fix
group.  The component to be set is defined by the {dim} keyword. If the keyword
{vel} is used, then the velocity of the particles in the fix group is specified
by the argument that follows this keyword. If the keyword {omega} is used the
same happens for the angular velocity of the particles in the fix group. 

The {dim} keyword must be used as well as either {vel} or {omega}.

If the optional {region} keyword is used, the atom must also be in the specified
geometric "region"_region.html in order to have the (angular) velocity component
set.

The fix also sets the force/torque component on the particle in the specified
direction to zero, so that an additional integrator (such as
"nve/sphere"_fix_nve_sphere.html) could be applied to the particles. 

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix does not need to write data to binary "restart files"_restart.html. None of the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this fix.
This fix computes a global scalar of the force, used to push the particles in the desired direction.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix has to be placed in the input script before the first fix which implements
the {initial_integrate()} function. This is typically implemented
by integrators, such as "nve/sphere"_fix_nve_sphere.html
The code will exit with an error if this is not the case. When applied to multispheres, 
only the optional keyword type is permitted, group and region are not admissible.

[Default:]

region = whole simulation box
