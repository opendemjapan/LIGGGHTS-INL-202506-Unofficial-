fix nve/sphere/limit command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/sphere/limit :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
nve/sphere/limit = style name of this fix command :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {update} or {vlimit} or {omegalimit} :l
  {update} value = {dipole}
    dipole = update orientation of dipole moment during integration
  {vlimit} value = vmax
    vmax = maximum velocity with which an atom can move
  {omegalimit} value = omegamax
    omegamax = maximum angular velocity with which an atom can rotate :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all nve/sphere/limit
fix 1 all nve/sphere/limit update dipole :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE integration similar to "fix nve/sphere"_fix_nve_sphere.html to update position, velocity, and angular velocity for finite-size spherical particles in the group each
timestep. 

If the {update} keyword is used with the {dipole} value, then the
orientation of the dipole moment of each particle is also updated
during the time integration.  This option should be used for models
where a dipole moment is assigned to particles via use of the
"atom_style dipole"_atom_style.html command.

Similar to "fix nve/limit"_fix_nve_limit.html for point atoms, this fix uses the keywords {vlimit} and {omegalimit} to define a maximum velocity and maximum angular velocity for finite-size spherical atoms. This is useful when starting a simulation with a configuration containing highly overlapped atoms. Normally this would generate huge forces which would blow atoms out of the simulation box.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a scalar which can be accessed by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_8. This scalar is the total number of
limited atoms of the fix group.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of 
the "run"_run.html command. This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix requires that atoms store torque and angular velocity (omega)
and a radius as defined by the "atom_style sphere"_atom_style.html
command.  If the {dipole} keyword is used, then they must also store a
dipole moment as defined by the "atom_style dipole"_atom_style.html
command.

All particles in the group must be finite-size spheres. They cannot
be point particles.
