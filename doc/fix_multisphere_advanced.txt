fix multisphere/advanced command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID multisphere/advanced :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l

:ule

[Examples:]

fix ms all multisphere/advanced

[Description:]

Treat one or more sets of atoms as independent rigid bodies.
The functionality is identical to the functionality in the
"fix multisphere"_fix_multisphere.html command. However,
there is one significant improvement: The interaction forces
for particle-particle and particle-wall collisions are re-scaled
so that the coefficient of restitution is correctly reproduced.
This is done by storing the interaction forces for each
particle-particle contact, tallying the number of body-body contacts
and then re-scaling the contact forces by the number of body-body
contacts.

Example: Assume that two bodies A and B are composed of spherical
particles A1, A2 (body A) and B1, B2 (body B).

A1 touches B1 - 1 contact A-B in total: The interaction forces between
particles A1 and B1 are calculated as usual.

A1 touches B1 and A2 touches B2 - 2 contacts A-B in total: The interaction
forces between particles A1 and B1 and between particles A2 and B2 are
divided by 2.

Important note: This command requires you to use the option
'store_force_contact yes' for all "fix wall/gran"_fix_wall_gran.html
commands.
