compute bond/counter command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID bond/counter general_keyword general_values :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
bond/counter = style name of this compute command :l
general_keywords general_values are documented in "compute"_compute.html" :l
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 all bond/counter :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that tracks the number of bonds from the "cohesion model
bond"_gran_cohesion_bond.html. Additionally it also tracks the number of bonds
created and destroyed since its last output. Bonds between particles and between
particles and walls are tracked separately.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector with six entries. The first three
entries correspond to the particle-particle bonds. The first two entries are the
number of bonds created and destroyed, respectively, since the last output of
this compute. The third entry is the number of intact bonds at the time of the
compute output. The last three entries are identical to the first three, except
that they store the information about particle-wall bonds.

These values can be used by any command that uses a global scalar value from a
compute as input.  See "Section_howto 8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 for an
overview of LIGGGHTS(R)-INL output options.
