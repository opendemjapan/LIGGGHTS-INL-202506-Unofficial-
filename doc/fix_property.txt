fix property/global command :h3
fix property/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix id group property/atom variablename style restartvalue comm_ghost_value comm_reverse_ghost_value defaultvalue(s)...
fix id group property/global variablename style stylearg type type_value (warn_out_of_bounds val) defaultvalue(s)... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
property/global or property/atom = style name of this fix command   :l
variablename = a valid C++ string :l
:ule

fix property/global:

    style = scalar or vector or peratomtype or atomtype or matrix or atomtypepair or peratomtypepair :ulb,l
    stylearg for scalar/vector: none
    stylearg for matrix/atomtypepair: nCols :pre
    type = optional keyword, if available must be followed by: :l
    type_value = constant or lookup :l
    warn_out_of_bounds = optional keyword for type lookup :l
    val = yes or no :l
:ule

fix property/atom:

    style = scalar or vector  :ulb,l
    restartvalue = yes or no :l
    communicate_ghost_value = yes or no :l
    communicate_reverse_ghost_value = yes or no :l
 :ule

[Description:]

[Fix property/atom] reserves per-atom properties to be accessed by the user or
other fixes.  Style {scalar} reserves one value per atom, style {vector}
multiple values per atoms, where the number of {defaultvalues} (that are
assigned to the atoms at creation) determines the length of the vector. The
group of atoms the fix is applied to is always "all", irrespective of which
group is used for the fix command . If you want to assign different values for
different groups, you can use the "set"_set.html command with keyword
'property/atom'.  Keyword {restartvalues} determines whether information about
the values stored by this fix is written to binary restart files.  Keyword
{communicate_ghost_value} determines whether information about the values stored
by this fix can be communicated to ghost particles (forward communication). The
exact location during a time-step when this happens depends on the model that
uses this fix.  Keyword {communicate_reverse_ghost_value} determines whether
information about the values stored by this fix can be communicated from ghost
particles to owned particles (reverse communication). The exact location during
a time-step when this happens depends on the model that uses this fix.

[Fix property/global] reserves global properties to be accessed by the user or
other fixes or pair styles. The number of defaultvalues determines the length of
the vector / the number of matrix components. For style {vector}, {peratomtype}
or {atomtype}, the user provides the number of vector components. For style
{matrix}, {peratomtypepair} or {atomtypepair}, the user provides the number of
matrix columns ({nCols}).

Example: {nCols}= 2 and {defaultvalues} = 1 2 3 4 5 6 would be mapped into a
matrix like

\[ 1 2 \]

\[ 3 4 \]

\[ 5 6 \]

Note that the number of default values must thus be a multiple of {nCols}.  Note
that {vector} and [per]{atomtype} do the same thing, [per]{atomtype} is just
provided to make input scripts more readable .  Note that {matrix} and
[per]{atomtypepair} both refer to a matrix of global values. However, a matrix
defined via [per]{atomtypepair} is required to be symmetric.

The default values are floating point numbers by default. If the {type} keyword
is used, then they are either floating point numbers or filenames if
{type_value} is constant or lookup, respectively. The lookup type allows to
specify a property that is a function of another variable. The function is
specified pointwise in a file and a linear interpolation is performed between
the points specified in the file. The file is structured as follows:

# Lines starting with '#' are ignored, e.g. for comments
0. 1.
1. 3.
2. 1.
6. 0. :pre

Note that the entries in the first column must be listed in ascending
order.  This specific type can only be used in combination with
specialized models. If the keyword {warn_out_of_bounds} is set to
{on}, the fix issues a warning every time a function value is
requested for an argument smaller than the first entry or larger than
the last entry of the function file (in the above example: < 0 or >
6). This is useful if you are tuning parameters and don't exactly know
which range to expect.

Note that the group of atoms the fix is applied to is ignored (as the fix is not
applied to atoms, but defines values of global scope).
